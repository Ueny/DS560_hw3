# Project Summary

MyWonder is a new platform for big data analytics and visualization. At the moment, users usually have to wait for hours to create visualizations from massive files. MyWonder utilizes an approach to distribute the files on the cloud very efficiently. In this way, the visualization process from massive files can be done even under 10 minutes, and users are able to calculate their analytics and summaries from their phones very easily, even before jumping to a meeting.

# Identified Tastes

- Skills: customers and the CEO don’t understand some terminology and contents like “test visualization”.
- Waiting: It takes a lot of time for the client to call the CEO for the response. The CEO also spends a lot of time constantly calling the customer support, who contacts the designer and the developer, and finally the backend team. 
- Transport: the contents updating needs to be transported from the CEO to the customer support, then to the designer and the developer, and finally the backend team is able to process the requirement. The long transportation line is costly, and the CEO only needs access to someone who can quickly change contents.
